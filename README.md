# Internship-task5
Day 5 Task of AI &amp; ML Internship – Decision Tree and Random Forest classification using Heart Disease dataset with pruning, visualization, and feature importance.
# Day 5 - Decision Trees & Random Forests

## 📌 Objective
Understand and implement Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms for classification using the Heart Disease dataset. Learn model visualization, overfitting control, and feature importance.

---

## 📂 Dataset
Used: [Heart Disease Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 What I Did
- Uploaded dataset and cleaned it
- Trained a basic Decision Tree model
- Visualized the tree using `plot_tree()`
- Controlled overfitting using `max_depth`
- Trained a Random Forest model
- Compared accuracy of both models
- Visualized Feature Importance
- Performed Cross-Validation

---

## ✅ Results

| Model            | Accuracy |
|------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree    | XX %     |
| Pruned Tree      | XX %     |
| Random Forest    | XX %     |
| Random Forest CV | XX %     |

📌 *(Replace XX with actual values from your notebook)*

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Difference between Decision Tree and Random Forest
- How to visualize a model
- Controlling overfitting
- Using Feature Importance for interpretation
- Ensemble learning increases accuracy
